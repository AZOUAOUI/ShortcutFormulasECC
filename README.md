This project contains:
  - A library elliptic.py to simulate ECC computation on a 32 bit micro-controller and leakage of the long integer multiplication. It can be used to produce the sim_2bit_alt simulation  dataset.
  - The sim_2it_alt simulation dataset. 
  - Simple example scripts to calculate the shortcut formulas for horizontal attacks on ECC.
